# ML Schedule Optimizer

An intelligent ML-powered task scheduler that predicts task stress levels and generates an optimized weekly schedule using machine learning and genetic algorithms. Users enter tasks, deadlines, and difficulty, and the system creates the most efficient, lowest-stress ordering of tasks.

## Features
- Predicts stress score for each task
- Optimizes task order using a Genetic Algorithm
- Simple web UI for entering tasks and viewing results
- Flask backend with ML + optimization logic

## Tech Stack
- Python (Flask)
- Scikit-learn
- DEAP for Genetic Algorithm
- HTML + JavaScript frontend

## Run Backend
